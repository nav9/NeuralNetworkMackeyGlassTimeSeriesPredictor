# Neural Network Mackey-Glass Time Series Predictor
Ever needed to predict the next sequence in seemingly random data? The Mackey Glass time series generates seemingly random data, based on what the researchers observed about the frequency of white blood cell production in the human body. This program uses trains a multilayer perceptron using feedforward and backpropagation, to train the neural network to learn the pattern of variations in the Mackey Glass time series. The second part of the program then uses the trained network to predict the next values of the time series, using the immediate 4 past inputs.
